    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 19, 2026</p>

    <p>Smart Parent Lock ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of you and your children. This
        Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, or phone numbers
        from our users, including children under the age of 13.</p>

    <h3>App Permissions</h3>
    <p>The app requires specific permissions to function correctly as a parental control tool:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Admin (BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN):</strong> Used solely to prevent unauthorized uninstallation of the
            app by the child. We do not use this to wipe data or enforce password rules outside of the app's own lock
            screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Display Over Other Apps (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW):</strong> Required to show the educational lock screen
            over other apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Access (Optional):</strong> May be requested to detect which apps are running to trigger the
            lock screen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All settings (PIN codes, challenge preferences, usage timers) are stored locally on your device. We do not
        transmit this personal configuration data to any external server.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services & Advertising</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use device identifiers (such as the
        Advertising ID) and potentially other non-personal data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Privacy Policy</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since this app is intended for families and may be used by children, we configure ad requests to comply with
        Google Play's Family Policy. However, parents should supervise device usage.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is designed to be safe for children. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
        We do not collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such
        information, please contact us immediately so we can remove it.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any
        changes. Changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>
